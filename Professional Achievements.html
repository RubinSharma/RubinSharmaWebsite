        <h3>Now, in this section we are going to talk about my professional experiences. </h3>
        <p>I never had to work while I was in school for secondary education and at college for my higher secondary education.
            Truly my professional journey began after I moved to Australia when I had to work inorder to complete my basic expenses and my college fee.
            I would be studying full-time at TAFE as well as other times at home to make sure I actually understand what I learned in college.
            <br>
            Making sure to balance my studies, work, and time for myself was a massive challange which I somewhat was able to overcome.

            After moving to Australia in 2018, I was very naive. I was unsure about a lot of thing but one thing I knew for sure was that I had to keep going and keep grinding.
            I am going to be very brief about what sort of jobs I did in my earlier days.
            <p>

        <h2>Experience in Hospitality and Trades Sector</h2>

            <img src="Pictures/KitchanHand.jpeg" alt="Reference photo taken of internet of someone working as a Kitchen Hand.">
            <p>
                My first job was of a <i>Kitchan Hand</i>. Even though it was very tough work, I was pleased that I was able to earn money for myself and that's what kept me going.
            </p>

        <div class="Cleaner">
            <h3>Cleaner</h3>

            <p>
                Later, I started working as a <i>Cleaner</i>. Even though the job required low cognitive and problem solving ability, I was able to meet a lot of interesting people which was a positive aspect of the job.

            <p>
                I also have worked as a <i>HouseKeeper</i> for a Hotel.

            <img src="Pictures/LandscaperGardener.jpeg" alt="Reference photo taken of internet of someone working as a LandscaperGardener.">            
            <p>
                During the COVID and cought between jobless market, I worked as a <i>LandscaperGardener</i>. This was one of the most physically demanding jobs I ever had to do till date. 
                Working in the sun all day made me realise how tough a tradie sector is. This made me respect those people even more.
                The are a true hero. They break themselves in half each day to keep up the infrastructure going.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, I was about to do a role which I believed required a lot of skill and attention i.e. as a <i>Barista</i>. Till date I have worked for multiple cafes as a Barista. 
                I have over 2 years of experience as a Barista. I have also been the Head Barista at one of the local cafe in my locality. I ended up working at thet cafe for about a year.
