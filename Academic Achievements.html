                <p>This school is very near and dear to me. I studied till primary level in this school so it holds a special spot in my heart.
                    Well, childhood bonds are truely very strong, I am still in contact with many friends till date. 
                    Later, I had to move to a different school to continue my education.

                <p>I completed my SLC from this school. This was my first milestone in my academic pathway.
                    I was able to make a lot of friends while I was at this school.
                    A lot of my close friends shared common interest, so, we were able to get along pretty well.
                    I still remember discussing all the Maths or Science questions during school times.
                    While after that, we used to hang out together to play cricket, football or any other common interest we shared.
                    It was indeed one of the most beautiful time I spent.

                <p>This was in some was my step into adulthood. Going into college was a great deal for me at that point.
                    The teachers were very different to schools. Eventhough, they were highly skilled in their profession, they were not spoon-feeding us anymore. 
                    The responsibility of our studies was solely on us now.
                    <br> 
                    This was a major point of realisation for me, meaning my actions and decisions were solely my responsibility and there won't be anyone else.
                    You may have family and friends to support you, but pretty much all of the responsibility of decision making would be on your shoulders.

                    <p>It is the year 2018. This is when I moved to Australia to continue my studies. This was one of the cannonical even that changed the course of my life.
                    <br>
                I came to realise how different life would be after moving to Australia. I was very naive. Slowly, I adapted myself to the lifestyle and culture in Australia and things started to become better.
                    <br>
                TAFE has been a really intgral part of my life. Most of the education were hands-on and practical based. I fell in love with studying. 
                The course in TAFE was really very varied. The studies topics included Networking, Programming, Cybersecurity, AWS cloud and many more.
                    <br>
                My completed Certificate III, Certificate IV, Diploma and Bachelor of Information Technology studing at TAFE and graduated December 2021.
                Still to this day, TAFE Meadowbank holds a special spot in my heart.
